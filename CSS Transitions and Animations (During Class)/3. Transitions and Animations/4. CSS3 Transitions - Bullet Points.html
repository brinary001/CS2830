            <p>Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation 
            	and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, 
            	structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures 
            	(or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, 
            	storage, communication of, and access to information. Some fields, such 
            	as computational complexity theory, are highly abstract, while fields 
            	such as <b>WEB DEVELOPMENET</b> emphasize real-world visual 
            	applications.</p>

			<p>Information technology (IT) is the application of computers and internet 
				to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often 
				in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered a 
				subset of information and communications technology (ICT).</p>

			<p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web 
			site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). 
			Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of
			plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic
			businesses, and social network services.</p>
