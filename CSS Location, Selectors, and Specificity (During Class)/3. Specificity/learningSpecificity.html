<!-- The main purpose is to show you specificity (a word I can not say very easily),
        Why specificity?  Because CSS priority is decided based on order and specificity
-->

<!-- Generally speaking:
        We can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
        1) Inline style (inside the HTML element)
        2) External and internal style sheets (in head element)
            * whichever one is loaded last will be the one with highest priority
        3) Browser Default
