        <!-- Note:
                Blocke element characteristics:
                    * Always start on and end with a new line.
                    * Take up the full width available
                        * Their width is 100% of their parent container
                        * They stretch out to the left and right as far as possible
                Examples:
                    <div>, <h1> - <h6>, <p> and <form> elements are block elements
        -->
        <div>
            <h1>My first header</h1>
            <h1>My second header</h1>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
            <p>paragraph #2</p>
            
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
